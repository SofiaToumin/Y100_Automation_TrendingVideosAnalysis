# Y100_Automation_TrendingVideosAnalysis
Project Description
You work as a video ad analyst at the Sterling &amp; Draper advertising agency. 
You devote a lot of time to analyzing trending videos on YouTube to determine what content deserves marketing attention.
Each video has a specific category (Entertainment, Music, News & Politics, etc.), region, and trending date.
A video can be in the trending section for several days in a row.
Every week, the new employees Melanie and Ashok ask you the same questions:
-What video categories were trending last week?
-How were they distributed among various regions?
-What categories were especially popular in the United States?
In your sixth week on the job, you decide that it's high time the process were automated. You're going to make a dashboard for Melanie and Ashok.

What steps need to be taken to design and build the dashboard?
You need to discuss the contents of the dashboard, its layout, and the data that needs to be displayed with Melanie and Ashok. 
Then talk to the database administrators and find out where and how the necessary data is collected. Don't forget to ask them where to store the aggregate tables. 
Finally, develop the pipeline and dashboard.

To build the dashboard, complete the following steps:
-Download the file https://storage.yandexcloud.net/*****/CA.pem to the folder with the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) that will be used to work with the database.
-Connect to the database
-In Jupyter, write code to download data from the trending_by_time table to the file trending_by_time.csv.
-In Tableau Public, use trending_by_time.csv to create a dashboard modeled on the draft.
-Publish the dashboard on the Tableau Public server.
-Use your dashboard to answer the questions the managers asked you:
  -Which video categories trended most often?
  -How were they distributed among regions?
  -What categories were especially popular in the United States? Were there any differences between the categories popular in the US and those popular elsewhere?
-Prepare a brief presentation containing a report (answers to these questions and graphs).
